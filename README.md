# Audio Decimation and FFT Analyzer on STM32F407 Discovery

## Project Overview
This project implements an audio processing application on the STM32F407 Discovery board. The key features include:

- **PDM to PCM Decimation**: Conversion of microphone PDM data to PCM format.
- **FFT Audio Analysis**: Real-time frequency analysis of the audio signal.

The application leverages the STM32F407â€™s capabilities, such as its DSP instructions and PDM microphone input, to process and analyze audio signals.

## Features

### 1. PDM to PCM Conversion
- The STM32F407 Discovery board includes a PDM microphone. The PDM signal is converted into PCM using:
  - A decimation filter.
  - Low-pass filtering to reconstruct the audio signal.
- The decimation and filtering processes are optimized for real-time performance.

### 2. FFT Audio Analyzer
- The FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) is used to analyze the frequency spectrum of the PCM audio signal.
- Key features:
  - Real-time visualization of audio frequencies.
  - Configurable FFT size (e.g., 256, 512, or 1024 points).
  - Scaled amplitude to identify dominant frequencies in the signal.

## Implementation Details

### Hardware Setup
- **STM32F407 Discovery Board**: Used for signal processing.
- **PDM Microphone**: Built-in on the board for audio input.
- **USB or UART**: To output FFT results or debug logs.

### Software Modules
- **PDM Decimation Module**:
  - Converts PDM data from the microphone to PCM data.
  - Configured using STM32 HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer).
  - Uses FIR filters for decimation.

- **FFT Module**:
  - Implements the Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm using CMSIS-DSP.
  - Processes PCM data to calculate frequency components.

- **Display or Debugging Interface**:
  - Outputs FFT data over UART or USB.
  - Displays frequency spectrum if connected to a GUI or terminal application.

### Workflow
1. **Data Acquisition**: PDM data is acquired from the microphone.
2. **Decimation**: The PDM data is decimated into PCM data using a filter.
3. **FFT Processing**: The PCM data is passed to the FFT module for frequency analysis.
4. **Output**: FFT results are transmitted via UART/USB for visualization or further analysis.
